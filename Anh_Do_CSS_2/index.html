            Welcome to our <span class="highlight bold"> Art Gallery</span>, a curated space where images are gathered with <em>care</em>, even if their origins are occasionally a bit unsteady. Each photograph offers an honest moment, shaped more by curiosity than perfection. The collection may wander in style and subject, yet its purpose remains sincere. Visitors are invited to explore at their own pace and enjoy the quiet charm within these frames.
            <br><br>Step into the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> to experience the modern art through each <picture class=""></picture>
            <br><br><strong>Every picture tells a story of life, adventure, and motion.</strong>
            <br><br.
            Credits to the photographers for the images used in this project.
